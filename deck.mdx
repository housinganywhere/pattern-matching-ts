# Pattern matching in TS

---

## What's pattern matching?

```notes
It makes sense to start defining what is it
```

---

```re
let str = "hola";

let result =
  switch(str) {
  | "hola" => "HOLA"
  | "chau" => "bye!"
  | _ => "..."
  };
```

---

```elm
num : Int
num = 1

result : String
result = 
  case num of
    1 -> "one"
    2 -> "two"
    _ -> "other"
```

---

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map _ []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

---

```elm
type alias State = Int

type Action
  = Inc
  | Dec

reducer : State -> Action -> State
reducer state action =
  case action of
    Inc -> state + 1
    Dec -> state - 1
```

---

```elm
type alias State = Int

type Action
  = Inc
  | Dec
  | Add Int

reducer : State -> Action -> State
reducer state action =
  case action of
    Inc -> state + 1
    Dec -> state - 1
    Add x -> state + x
```

## We can only hope ...

<https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching>

---

## Meanwhile ...

---

```js
const fn = R.cond([
  [R.equals(0),   R.always('water freezes at 0°C')],
  [R.equals(100), R.always('water boils at 100°C')],
  [R.T,           t => `nothing special happens at ${t}°C`],
])

fn(0)   // => 'water freezes at 0°C'
fn(50)  // => 'nothing special happens at 50°C'
fn(100) // => 'water boils at 100°C'
```

```notes
- NOT type safe
- Very limited
```

---

## What about TypeScript?

```notes
Doesn't support pattern matching per se but ...
```

---

## Many approaches

(list them)

---

<https://github.com/housinganywhere/match>

---

```ts
import match from '@housinganywhere/match'

type Variant =
  | 'success'
  | 'danger'
  | 'warning'

const variantColor = match<Variant, string>({
  success: () => 'green',
  danger: () => 'red',
  warning: () => 'yellow',
})
```

---

```ts
import * as React from 'react'
import match from '@housinganywhere/match'

const enum PayoutTypes {
  Iban = 'iban',
  Bank = 'bank',
  Paypal = 'paypal',
}

const PayoutMethod = ({ payoutMethod, payoutType }) => 
  <div>
    {match<PayoutTypes, React.ReactNode>({
      [PayoutTypes.Iban]: () => (
        <IbanMethod method={payoutMethod} isNew={!payoutMethod} />
      ),
      [PayoutTypes.Bank]: () => (
        <BankMethod method={payoutMethod} isNew={!payoutMethod} />
      ),
      [PayoutTypes.Paypal]: () => (
        <PaypalMethod method={payoutMethod} isNew={!payoutMethod} />
      ),
    })(payoutType)}
  </div>
```
